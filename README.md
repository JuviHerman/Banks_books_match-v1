# Banks_books_match-v1

I ran into the idea of writing this code when I once received an unbeleivable task:
"match 6000 records in bank statements to 5500 records in company books".
After using this code, I trunqed the task at hand to only 900 and 700 respectively.

Sometimes, businesses move from one bookkeeping system to another.
In that process, it could happen that the matchings between bank and company are lost,
and needed to be processed all over again.
the following code is not perfect, but helps minimizing the task.
